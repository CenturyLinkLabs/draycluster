## NOTE

These images are for use with [Panamax](http://panamax.io), from CenturyLink Labs and not for stand-alone use. They leverage [Dray](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/centurylink/dray/) to allow for automated cluster creation into several Cloud Providers with orchestration frameworks and [Panamax Remote Agent](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/centurylink/panamax-remote-agent/) pre-installed. This allows deployment of applications/templates from Panamax directly to the cluster hosted on your cloud provider.
